# Awesome email

A community maintained and organized list of reputable, reliable and (reasonably) private[^1] e-mail providers.

All of these services, except Posteo, support custom domains â€” using a custom domain that you own is typically recommended for portability. Should something happen to your provider, you can update your [MX records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record), import your mail and move on.
