# Contribution guidelines

Contributions to the repository are welcome and encouraged. If you have a tool that you think fits, add it to the appropriate category and open a pull request.

- Keep formatting and categorization consistent (or if you think we should reorganize it, make a compelling case to do so).
- Provide a brief description of the addition in your pull request

Most importantly, be kind.
